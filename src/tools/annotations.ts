/**
 * MCP tool annotations (#565 / A0-002, A4-005).
 *
 * Before this module, 0 of 608 tools carried `annotations`, so a host could not
 * tell `get_track` (safe read) from `remove_duplicate_playlist_items` (destroys
 * playlist rows) and had to either prompt for everything or nothing. The SDK
 * projects `annotations` straight from its registry and exposes
 * `registeredTool.update({ annotations })` — so classification is applied once,
 * after registration, from this table rather than at 500+ call sites.
 *
 * Classification is FAIL-CLOSED: a tool is read-only only when its name starts
 * with an allowlisted non-mutating verb AND does not start with a mutating one —
 * except for the plans and previews listed in NEVER_MUTATING_PLANS below. Name
 * suffixes alone prove nothing: most `dry_run`-carrying `*_plan` tools accept a
 * commit path, so a new plan/preview tool defaults to "write" until someone
 * verifies its handler and adds it to that set. Anything unknown advertises as
 * a write and the host keeps its confirmation.
 *
 * Wire cost is kept low on purpose (the host pays it every session):
 *  - read-only tools emit `{ readOnlyHint: true }` (+ `idempotentHint` when true);
 *  - destructive tools emit `{ destructiveHint: true }`;
 *  - other writes emit `{ destructiveHint: false }`, because MCP's default for
 *    `destructiveHint` is TRUE — omitting it would advertise `save_to_library`
 *    as dangerous as `remove_saved_items`;
 *  - no `title` (hosts fall back to the tool name; duplicating it cost ~25 KB).

 * Plans and previews whose handlers provably never mutate — each entry was

 * only; no `client.post/put/delete`, no local file writes, no commit branch):
 *
 * - undo_preview (exhaust2_misc.ts) — verifyReceipt plus one optional playlist
 *   GET; the description's own dry-run framing matches the code.
 * - decade_sampler_plan (swarm3_discovery.ts) — saved-album walks only.
 * - album_representative_plan (swarm3_discovery.ts) — GET /albums/{id} plus a
 *   paged tracks walk; returns a sampling computation.
 * - front_to_back_plan (swarm3_discovery.ts) — GET /albums/{id} plus a paged
 *   tracks walk; returns cumulative start times.
 * - plan_volume_level_across_devices (swarm3_playback.ts) — device GETs, then
 *   returns PUT call *strings*; nothing is executed.
 * - queue_prune_plan (swarm3_playback.ts) — queue GET only; there is no
 *   queue-removal endpoint, so the output can only be acted on by playing it.
 * - sleep_timer_plan (swarm3_playback.ts) — queue GET plus a greedy fill;
 *   the "final pause call" is returned as data, not issued.
 * - sort_playlist_plan (swarm3_playlistops.ts) — GET plus a pure in-memory
 *   reorder; the commit path lives in the separate sort_playlist_apply.
 * - playlist_union_preview (swarm3_playlistops.ts) — GET plus exclusivity
 *   stats; no dry_run param exists at all.
 * - dedupe_playlist_plan (swarm3_playlistops.ts) — GET plus a duplicate
 *   census; its description names dedupe_playlist_apply as the committer.
 * - stale_saved_shows_plan (swarm3_shows.ts) — GET plus prune-candidate
 *   computation; "read-only by design … never unfollows anything".
 * - mark_episode_played_plan (swarm3_shows.ts) — GET resume points; "Read-only
 *   by design" because Spotify removed the mark-played API (#230).
 * - show_backlog_plan (swarm3_shows.ts) — GET plus ordering; "dry-run only,
 *   never mutates".
 * - restore_playlist_plan (swarm3_snapshots.ts) — live-state GET plus snapshot
 *   file reads; "Read-only plan … never mutates".
 * - merge_snapshot_changes_plan (swarm3_snapshots.ts) — GET plus snapshot file
 *   reads; no commit branch exists in the handler.
 * - snapshot_retention_plan (swarm3_snapshots.ts) — local snapshot file reads
 *   only; execution lives in prune_old_snapshots.
 * - playlist_chunk_preview (swarm4_playlists.ts) — GET plus arithmetic;
 *   "Read-only pagination preview".
 * - plan_podcast_session (podcastsession.ts) — candidate GETs returning a
 *   packing; no dry_run param and no commit branch (that lives in the
 *   separate start_podcast_session).
 *
 * Anything named `*_plan`/`*_preview` that is NOT in this set is classified as
 * a write, even when its description says "read-only": preview-by-default
 * handlers that accept dry_run=false execute (apply_volume_plan,
 * split_queue_plan, reverse_/rotate_/interleave_/merge_/difference_playlist_plan).
